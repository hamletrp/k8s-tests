🔧 Cluster Lifecycle Management
    - Install and configure clusters (e.g., using kubeadm, eksctl, GKE, AKS)
    - Upgrade clusters to newer Kubernetes versions
    - Scale clusters horizontally (nodes) and vertically (resources)
    - Backup and restore cluster state and etcd

🔐 Access & Security
    - Configure RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) and IAM integrations (e.g., AWS IAM, GCP IAM)
    - Manage kubeconfig files and access credentials
    - Set up network policies and PodSecurityStandards (PSS)
    - Integrate OIDC, SSO, and external secrets providers

📦 Application Management
    - Use Helm, Kustomize, or GitOps (e.g., Argo CD) to deploy apps
    - Create and manage Namespaces, Deployments, Services, Ingress, etc.
    - Debug pods using tools like kubectl logs, describe, and exec
    - Configure and manage Horizontal Pod Autoscalers (HPA) and Cluster Autoscalers

💾 Storage & Volumes
    - Set up Persistent Volumes (PV) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)
    - Configure storage classes and dynamic provisioning (e.g., AWS EBS, Longhorn, Rook)
    - Monitor storage utilization and cleanup orphaned volumes

📡 Networking
    - Configure and manage ingress controllers (e.g., NGINX, AWS ALB)
    - Debug service discovery and DNS issues
    - Understand CNI plugins (e.g., Calico, AWS VPC CNI)
    - Handle load balancers, external IPs, and network policies

📈 Monitoring, Logging & Observability
    - Install and configure Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Fluent Bit, Elastic Stack, etc.
    - Set up alerts and dashboards
    - Monitor resource utilization, pod health, and node metrics


🔁 CI/CD and Automation
    - Integrate clusters with CI/CD tools (e.g., GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, Jenkins)
    - Implement GitOps workflows using Argo CD or Flux
    - Automate cluster maintenance with cronjobs and custom controllers

📜 Compliance & Governance
    - Implement audit logging and security benchmarks (e.g., CIS)
    - Enforce image scanning and admission controllers (e.g., OPA Gatekeeper)
    - Manage cluster policies (e.g., Kyverno, PodSecurityPolicies/PSS)

☁️ Cloud-Native Integrations
    - Manage managed Kubernetes services like EKS, GKE, AKS
    - Provision and manage cloud resources using Terraform or CloudFormation
    - Set up addons (e.g., ExternalDNS, Cluster Autoscaler, Karpenter)
